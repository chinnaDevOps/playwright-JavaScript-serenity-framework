## 📊 Reporting

After execution, Serenity reports are generated at:

```bash
target/site/serenity/
```

Open the report in your browser to view:

* Test results
* Step-level details
* Execution timeline
* Screenshots (if configured)

---

## 🧩 Key Features

* ✅ Page Object Model (POM) structure
* ✅ Serenity/JS rich reporting
* ✅ Cross-browser support via Playwright
* ✅ Environment-based configuration
* ✅ Tag-based test execution (`@ui`, `@regression`, etc.)
* ✅ Easy CI/CD integration

---

## 🛠️ Useful Scripts (Example)

Add these to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rimraf target",
  "test": "playwright test",
  "test:regression": "playwright test --grep @regression",
  "test:report": "serenity-bdd run"
}
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure Playwright browsers are installed:

  ```bash
  npx playwright install
  ```
* Customize environment variables as needed.
* Use tags to control execution scope.
